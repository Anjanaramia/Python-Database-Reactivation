Real Estate Lead Scoring & Automation

This project automates the categorization of real estate leads by calculating a "Lead Temperature" based on behavioral data and budget parameters.

Key Features:

1.Dynamic Scoring Logic: Categorizes leads based on Lead_Type (Buyer vs. Seller).

2.Behavioral Weighted Metrics: Assigns points for email opens, link clicks, and showing requests.

3.Automatic Categorization: Groups leads into Hot, Warm, and Cold buckets for prioritized follow-up.

Tech Stack:

1.Python: Core logic.

2.Pandas: Data manipulation and restructuring.

How to Run:

-Ensure you have pandas installed.

-Place your lead database as Restructured_Leads_Database.csv in the root folder.

-Run LeadScoringandLeadTemperature.py.

Project Roadmap:

Day 1 – Create 300-lead mock database  

Day 2 – Build scoring logic 

Day 3 – Build dormant detection logic

Day 4 – Build reactivation email sequence

Day 5 – Generate prioritized follow-up list

Day 6 – Create case study PDF

Day 7 – Turn into consulting offer
