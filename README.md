2.Behavioral Weighted Metrics: Assigns points for email opens, link clicks, and showing requests.

3.Automatic Categorization: Groups leads into Hot, Warm, and Cold buckets for prioritized follow-up.

Tech Stack:

1.Python: Core logic.

2.Pandas: Data manipulation and restructuring.

How to Run:

-Ensure you have pandas installed.

-Place your lead database as Restructured_Leads_Database.csv in the root folder.

-Run LeadScoringandLeadTemperature.py.
